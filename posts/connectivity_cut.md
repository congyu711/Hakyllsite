As a natural generalization of min-cut, the following problem seems interesting to me,

:::{.Problem #prob1}
Given a graph $G=(V,E)$ and an integer $k$, find the minimum edge set whose removal breaks $k$-vertex connectivity?

# Checking $k$-vertex connectivity

Checking if a given graph is $k$-vertex connected [can be done in polynomial time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-vertex-connected_graph#Computational_complexity).
By [Menger's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menger%27s_theorem) we need to check if for every vertex pair $(s,t)$ there are at least $k$ vertex disjoint paths (excluding $s$ and $t$) connecting $s$ and $t$. The number of vertex disjoint paths between $s$ and $t$ can be easily computed through max flow. 
<!-- Duplicate every vertex except $s$ and $t$ and connect an directed edge with capacity 1 between every pair of new vertices. The capacity is 1 for all edges.  -->
We replace every internal vertex $v$ with two copies $v_{in}$ and $v_{out}$ and add directed edges from $N(v)$ to $v_{in}$ and from $v_{out}$ to $N(v)$ with capacity 1. The integral max flow is the number of internally disjoint paths between $s$ and $t$. 
Since the constraint matrix of flow problems is TU, maximizing the flow gives us the vertex connectivity.

> Instead of computing the flow for every pair, if we want one flow that gets the demand for every vertex pair $(i<j)$, the problem becomes much harder. This is [Multi-commodity flow problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-commodity_flow_problem).

Currently the fastest algorithm for computing vertex connectivity is ~~[@HENZINGER2000222]~~ <https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3406325.3451088>.
There is a nice table for a summary of connectivity related algorithms.

[@HENZINGER2000222] appears in the last line. The conference version was published on FOCS96.

## Minimum cut for edge connectivity

Finding the minimum edge set whose removal breaks the $k$-edge connectivity is easy. It is known that the global min-cut is the edge connectivity number. Thus we can simply compute the min-cut and remove any number of the edges as needed.

## Minimum cut for vertex connectivity

With the knowledge of how to compute vertex connectivity, we try to compute the minimum cut for $k$-vertex connectivity in a similar way. First we can find the vertex pair $(s,t)$ with the smallest number of internally disjoint paths. Note that we are dealing with the modified graph when computing the vertex connectivity number with flow. Hence the min-cut may contain edges that are not in the original graph, i.e., the edges connecting $v_{in}$ and $v_{out}$. For example, consider a graph where every edge has multiplicities 2. The min-cut reported by the flow algorithm should only contain edges between $v_{in}$ and $v_{out}$.

There is a [list](https://lemon.cs.elte.hu/egres/open/Node-connectivity) of open problems on vertex(node) connectivity. I guess [@prob1] is NP-hard but cannot prove it.

# Connectivity interdiction

Connectivity interdiction is first studied by Zenklusen [@zenklusen_connectivity_2014].

::: Problem
Given a graph $G=(V,E)$ and costs $c:E\to \Z_+$ and weights $w:E\to \Z_+$ and a budget $B\in \Z_+$, find the edge set $R$ such that $c(R)\leq B$ and that minimizes the $w$-weighted min cut in $(V,E\setminus R)$.
:::


A recent paper [@vygen_fptas_2024] gives an FPTAS for the problem. Here I try to develop the intuition since I have never seen an algorithm based on reweighting edges this complicated and ingenious.

First one can see that the optimal solution can always be a subset of edges in a cut of $G$. This is because if the optimal solution $R^*$ contains any edge not in the cut, we can safely delete it from $R^*$. Thus the optimal solution is indeed a pair $(C^*,R^*\subset C^*)$. The authors call this problem the *$b$-free min-cut problem* ($b$ is the budget and we are allowed to pick edges for free in the "mincut" with total weight at most $b$).

So the goal is to find a FPTAS for the $b$-free mincut problem. The problem is hard since it contains knapsack as a special case. (Consider a graph with many parallel edges and only 2 vertices.) However, it is known that there is a [FPTAS for knapsack](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15854-f05/www/scribe/lec10.pdf). If we know part of the optimal solution, i.e., $C^*$, we can use the FPTAS for knapsack to find the optimal $R^*$.

At this stage, if there is a hint suggesting reweighting the edges, I would guess that $C^*$ is exactly (or close to) the min-cut of the re-weighted graph. Based on this idea I would also guess that, although the connectivity interdiction problem ($b$-free min-cut) is NP-hard, $C^*$ can be computed in polynomial time. In other words, the intractable part is solving the knapsack in $C^*$. This statement seems reasonable, since this problem is know to be in P for unit costs and in that case the kanpsack is trivial. Let's assume that my guess is correct and work on the reweighting part.

## Reweighting

There is a [chapter on reweighting](https://sarielhp.org/teach/notes/aprx/lec/18_reweight.pdf) in Sariel Har-Peled's gemetric approximation book(not quite the same as the reweighting technique in [@vygen_fptas_2024]). Is reweighting a common technique for designing approximation algorithms?

One possible weight function is setting $w(e)=0$ for all $e\in R^*$... However, this is cheating since we assume that $R^*$ is the hard part. So now we need to find a weight function such that the following holds,

1. The min-cut of the re-weighted graph is close to $C^*$.
2. Computing the weight function takes polynomial time.

From the "cheating" example we can see that knowing $R^*$ does help but computing $R^*$ is hard. So maybe we can find a slightly worse weight function which is a lot easier to compute. So it seems like we are making a trade-off between how close the global min-cut of the re-weighted graph is to $C^*$, and how much time is needed to compute this weight function. This paper indeed does a great job in finding such a balance.
I sent an email to one of the authors to ask for the intuition behind the reweighting but did not get a real answer. They suggested reading [@zenklusen_connectivity_2014].
Zenklusen did almost the same thought experiment as above. Instead of using reweighting, he indirectly enumerated $R^*$. Consider the unit cost case for example. If the optimal cut $C^*$ is given, the interdicted edges $R^*$ will be those $b$ edges in $C^*$ with heaviest weights. We cannot directly enumerate $R^*$ since it still takes exponential time. What we can enumerate is a lowerbound of the weight of edges in $R^*$. Set all edges with weights exceeding this lowerbound to be in $R^*$ and find global min-cut with additional budget constraint on these edges. Then we have only $m$ lowerbound to enumerate and the budgeted min-cut can be computed fast. For general costs, he enumerated the set of ${1}/{\varepsilon}$ edges with heaviest weights in $C^*$.


The plan is to figure out how did the authors come up with the weight function in [@vygen_fptas_2024] and if it is possible to find a better weight function.

The key part is the following new problem called normilized min-cut,

::: {.Problem title="Normalized min-cut"#normmincut} 
Given a problem instance of connectivity interdiction, find a cut $C$ and its subset $F\subset C$ s.t. $0\leq c(F)\leq b$ and $\frac{w(C\setminus F)}{b+1-c(F)}$ is minimized.
:::

I have been thinking for a while how this problem is involved but have no clue. However, it indeed works... The weight function is defined based on an estimation of [Problem 3](#normmincut). The authors claim that the optimal solution to b-free min-cut problem is a 2-approximate min-cut of the reweighted graph. Then they enumerate all 2-approximate min-cut of the reweighted graph and run the FPTAS for knapsack on each cut.
