There is nothing new in this post. I found this problem while searching for methods for reducing the dimension of LPs. I read this [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colour_refinement_algorithm) and was surprised that this can be done in $O(m\log n)$ time.

The algorithm is described in [@cardon_partitioning_1982].


# ~~Definition~~

I think the demonstration in [@cardon_partitioning_1982] is excellent so there is no need for a blog post. The first 3 sections answered everything I wondered while reading the wikipedia page,

- are these definitions equivalent? `Basic Lemma 1`
- what's the intuition? `Section 2. The partitioning algorithm`
- ...
