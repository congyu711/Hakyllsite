ACM, 1995] for solving linear programs with n constraints and d variables in d(7+o(1))dn deterministic time. The time bound can be improved to d(5+o(1))dn with subsequent work by Br\"{o}nnimann, Chazelle, and Matou\v{s}ek [SIAM J. Comput., 1999]. We first point out a much simpler derandomization of Clarkson’s algorithm that avoids ε-approximations and runs in d(3+o(1))dn time. We then describe a few additional ideas that eventually improve the deterministic time bound to d(1/2+o(1))dn.},

	abstract = {PROPORTION EXTEND SORT is a new sorting algorithm, the basic principle of which is similar to PROPORTION SPLIT SORT. This algorithm sorts a sequence by constructing three subproblems, using a QuickSort-like pivot technique and solving recursively each subproblem. The original problem and three subproblems all are of such a structure: a sorted subsequence followed by an unsorted subsequence. The size of the original problem always equals the size of the third subproblem, but in general, the sorted subsequence of the third subproblem is p+1 times as much as the sorted subsequence of the original, where p is a fixed positive constant. The worst case number of comparisons required by this algorithm is less than 1/log (1+1/(2p2 +2p-1))nlog n for \$p {\textbackslash}geq 1\$. Empirical results show that the average number of comparisons is close to n log n-O(n) for some p. From our experiments for sorting integers, when p = 16, this algorithm is yet faster, on average, than PROPORTION SPLIT SORT which is faster than CLEVER QUICKSORT.},

abstract = {An assignment of colours to the vertices of a graph is stable if any two vertices of the same colour have identically coloured neighbourhoods. The goal of colour refinement is to find a stable colouring that uses a minimum number of colours. This is a widely used subroutine for graph isomorphism testing algorithms, since any automorphism needs to be colour preserving. We give an O((m + n)log n) algorithm for finding a canonical version of such a stable colouring, on graphs with n vertices and m edges. We show that no faster algorithm is possible, under some modest assumptions about the type of algorithm, which captures all known colour refinement algorithms.},
