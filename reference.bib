ACM, 1995] for solving linear programs with n constraints and d variables in d(7+o(1))dn deterministic time. The time bound can be improved to d(5+o(1))dn with subsequent work by Br\"{o}nnimann, Chazelle, and Matou\v{s}ek [SIAM J. Comput., 1999]. We first point out a much simpler derandomization of Clarkson’s algorithm that avoids ε-approximations and runs in d(3+o(1))dn time. We then describe a few additional ideas that eventually improve the deterministic time bound to d(1/2+o(1))dn.},

	abstract = {PROPORTION EXTEND SORT is a new sorting algorithm, the basic principle of which is similar to PROPORTION SPLIT SORT. This algorithm sorts a sequence by constructing three subproblems, using a QuickSort-like pivot technique and solving recursively each subproblem. The original problem and three subproblems all are of such a structure: a sorted subsequence followed by an unsorted subsequence. The size of the original problem always equals the size of the third subproblem, but in general, the sorted subsequence of the third subproblem is p+1 times as much as the sorted subsequence of the original, where p is a fixed positive constant. The worst case number of comparisons required by this algorithm is less than 1/log (1+1/(2p2 +2p-1))nlog n for \$p {\textbackslash}geq 1\$. Empirical results show that the average number of comparisons is close to n log n-O(n) for some p. From our experiments for sorting integers, when p = 16, this algorithm is yet faster, on average, than PROPORTION SPLIT SORT which is faster than CLEVER QUICKSORT.},

The goal of colour refinement is to find a stable colouring that uses a minimum number of colours. This is a widely used subroutine for graph isomorphism testing algorithms, since any automorphism needs to be colour preserving. We give an O((m + n)log n) algorithm for finding a canonical version of such a stable colouring, on graphs with n vertices and m edges. We show that no faster algorithm is possible, under some modest assumptions about the type of algorithm, which captures all known colour refinement algorithms.},

We extend this result to ℜ3 by computing constrained smallest enclosing sphere centered on a given sphere. We generalize the result for the case of points in ℜd where the center of the minimum enclosing ball lies inside a given ball. We show that similar problem of computing minimum intersecting/stabbing ball for a set of hyper planes in ℜd can also be solved using similar techniques. We also show how the minimum intersecting disk with the center constrained on a given disk can be computed to intersect a set of convex polygons. Lastly, we show that this technique is applicable when the center of minimum enclosing/intersecting ball lies in a convex region bounded by constant number of non-linear constraints with computability assumptions. We solve each of these problems in linear time in input size for fixed dimension.},

The Matroid Covering and Packing Theorems state that the minimum number of independent sets whose union is E is ⌈β(M)⌉, and the maximum number of disjoint bases is ⌊φ(M)⌋. We prove refinements of these theorems. If β(M)=k+ε, where k≥0 is an integer and 0≤ε{\textless}1, then E can be partitioned into k+1 independent sets with one of size at most ε⋅rM(E). If φ(M)=k+ε, then M has k+1 disjoint independent sets such that k are bases and the other has size at least ε⋅rM(E).
